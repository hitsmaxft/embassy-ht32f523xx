  Embassy-HT32F523xx Development Progress

  Phase 1: Basic HAL Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

  - ‚úÖ Rename crate from embassy-ht32 to embassy-ht32f523xx
  - ‚úÖ Fix USB HID keyboard example compilation issues
  - ‚úÖ Update to Rust 2024 edition
  - ‚úÖ Upgrade embassy crates to latest versions (0.9.0, 0.5.0, etc.)
  - ‚úÖ Resolve dependency conflicts and API compatibility

  Phase 2: Hardware Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

  - ‚úÖ Complete PAC integration and proper clock management
    * Fixed PLL calculations using correct HT32F523xx formula
    * Implemented proper HSI/HSE ready checking with wait loops
    * Enhanced peripheral clock control for all GPIO ports including GPIOD
  - ‚úÖ Add more comprehensive GPIO pin definitions
    * Added all 64 GPIO pins (PA0-PA15, PB0-PB15, PC0-PC15, PD0-PD15)
    * Complete GPIOD support including clock management
    * Consistent API patterns across all GPIO ports with pin accessor methods
  - ‚úÖ Implement proper interrupt handling
    * Embassy interrupt framework with NVIC support and waker system
    * EXTI (External Interrupt) support for GPIO pins with async/await
    * Async GPIO interrupt methods: pin.wait_for_interrupt(edge).await

  Phase 3: Advanced Features üîÑ IN PROGRESS

  - üîÑ Complete USB HID functionality testing
    * USB driver implementation with embassy-usb-driver traits
    * Need to test actual USB HID keyboard functionality
  - ‚è≥ Re-enable and fix RMK keyboard example
    * RMK example currently disabled due to incomplete USB driver
    * Need GPIO API migration and USB completion
  - ‚è≥ Add more example projects (SPI, I2C, etc.)
  - ‚è≥ Fix linker script memory regions for defmt in examples

  Phase 4: Documentation & Publishing

  - ‚è≥ Complete API documentation
  - ‚è≥ Usage guides and tutorials
  - ‚è≥ Prepare for crates.io publishing

  ## Current Status: Phase 2 Complete ‚úÖ

  The project now has a solid foundation with:

  ### ‚úÖ Clock Management
  - Proper PLL calculations: Output = Input * ((PFBD + 2) / (2^POTD))
  - HSI/HSE oscillator support with ready checking
  - Peripheral clock control for GPIO, AFIO, USART, USB, Timers

  ### ‚úÖ GPIO System
  - Complete pin coverage: 64 pins across GPIOA/B/C/D
  - Type-safe pin modes with const generics
  - embedded-hal trait implementations
  - Alternate function configuration via AFIO

  ### ‚úÖ Interrupt System
  - Embassy async interrupt framework
  - NVIC interrupt handlers for GPTM, USART, USB, EXTI
  - AtomicWaker-based async interrupt waiting
  - GPIO external interrupt support

  ### ‚úÖ Embassy Integration
  - Rust 2024 edition compliance
  - Latest embassy crate versions (embassy-executor 0.9.0, etc.)
  - Proper async/await patterns throughout
  - Compatible with embassy-time and embassy-sync

  ## Next Steps: Phase 3 Focus

  Moving forward to complete USB HID functionality and enable practical
  keyboard applications with the RMK framework.
